# NS-bot-x

NS-bot-x is a Discord bot. He answers when you talk to him. He can <em><small>approximately</small></em> translate sentences from any language to any other language, say things in voice channels, create polls, insult or compliment people, and do a lot of other cool stuff.

Add your own API keys in bot.js ;)

# Hosting

I use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host my bot (this is why the Procfile is present), it is basically free for non-intensive usage.
